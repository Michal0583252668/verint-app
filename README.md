01 - Components
---------------

We've added few components and used few kind of bindings, such as {{ }}, [] and ().
{{ }} is interpolation binding of data flowing to the html,
[] is binding from the data source to the DOM property of the HTML control (<img [src]="data">)
And () is event binding from the template to the data source, such as click event (<button (click)="handler">)
